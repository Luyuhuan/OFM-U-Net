Optical Flow-Enhanced Mamba U-Net for Cardiac Phase Detection in Ultrasound Videos

## Motivation
The detection of cardiac phase in ultrasound videos, identifying end-systolic (ES) and end-diastolic (ED) frames, is a critical step in assessing cardiac function, monitoring structural changes, and diagnosing congenital heart disease.
Current popular methods use recurrent neural networks to track dependencies over long sequences, but overlook the short-term movement of heart valves that sonographers normally rely on.
In this research, we propose a novel optical flow-enhanced Mamba U-net framework, designed to utilize both short-term motion and long-term information to detect the cardiac cycle phase in ultrasound videos.
